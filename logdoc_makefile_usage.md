## ‚úÖ Recommended Workflow

Follow this recommended workflow when actively developing or maintaining the project:

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is active
make check-env

# Install logdoc CLI (editable mode)
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Lint and format your code
make lint
make format

# Clean temporary files after changes
make clean
```

---

## üö© Specific Usage Examples

### Link and Inject to Another Project

```bash
make link
```

This command will copy and inject logdoc into the sibling project (`../scannest-ml`).

### Inject Only (Without Linking)

```bash
make inject
```

Inject logging/documentation headers into files in an existing deployment.

---

## üì¶ Requirements Management

```bash
make freeze
```

Generates `requirements.txt` from your existing `requirements.in`. Ensure `pip-tools` is installed.

---

## üßπ Cleaning Temporary Files

To remove build artifacts, `.pyc` files, and `__pycache__`:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## üìö Getting Help

To quickly see available commands and usage:

```bash
make help
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Makefile Commands from Other Repositories

To invoke the `logdoc` Makefile commands from another repository, use the `-C` flag as shown below:

```bash
make -C /path/to/logdoc <target>
```

### Example Usage

```bash
make -C ~/development/byterider-helper-mods install
make -C ~/development/byterider-helper-mods link
```

Replace `/path/to/logdoc` with the actual path to your logdoc repository.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Ensure paths specified in the Makefile are accurate.
- Confirm `requirements.in` exists before running `make freeze`.
